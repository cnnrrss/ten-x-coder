# Amazon Redshift

- Redshift is a columnar SQL Database
- Redshift is a fork of Postgres Database
- Redshift consists of one Leader Node and several Compute Nodes. Each compute node is made up of slices. Each slice is a computing unit.

Redshift delivers fast query performance on datasets ranging in
size from gigabytes to exabytes. Redshift uses columnar storage, data compression, and zone maps to reduce the amount of I/O needed to perform queries. It uses a massively parallel processing (MPP) data warehouse architecture to parallelize and distribute SQL operations to take advantage of all available resources

Amazon Redshift uses machine learning to deliver high throughout based on your workloads. Redshift utilizes sophisticated algorithms to predict incoming query run times, and assigns them to the optimal queue for the fastest processing.
