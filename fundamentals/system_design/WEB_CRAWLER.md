# Design a Web crawler or Type-Ahead (search enginer related services)

### Type-Ahead
- How to store previous search queries?

- How to keep the data fresh?

- How to find the best matches to the already typed string?

- How to handle updates and the user is typing too fast?


### Web Crawler
- How to find new web pages?
    - Seed URL
    - Depth
    - (.gitignore like rulesets) && the hosts `robot.txt`
    
- How to prioritize web pages that change dynamically?

- How to ensure that your crawler is not infinitely stuck on the same domain?
