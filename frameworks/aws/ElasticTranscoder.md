# Elastic Transcoder

Amazon Elastic Transcoder lets you convert media fles that you have stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) into media fles in the formats required by consumer playback devices. For example, you can convert large, high-quality digital media fles into formats that users can play back on mobile devices, tablets, web browsers, and connected televisions.

- Enables a RESTful web service that uses HTTPS as the protocol and JSON as msg fmt
- Allows app code to make requests directly to the Elastic Transcoder
