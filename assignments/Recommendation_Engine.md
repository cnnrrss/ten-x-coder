[Good Paper Chapter 9](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/book.pdf)

Two Approaches:

- Characterize by features: 
    - e.g. stars of a movie, recommend items with the same features as those the user(media) is known to like
    - look at preferences similar to that of the user in question (collaborative filtering)
