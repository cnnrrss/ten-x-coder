# Glue

Fully managed ETL service that makes it simple and cost-effective to categorize, clean, enrich, and move data reliably between data stores.

AWS Glue acts as the ETL Engine and **Glue Data Catalog** acts as the central metadata repository

### Glue Data Catalog

A persistent metadata store. Managed servce that lets you store, annotate, and share metadata in the AWS Cloud in the same way you would in an Apache _Hive_ metastore.

Provides a uniform repo where disparate systems can store and find metadata to keep track of data in silos.
