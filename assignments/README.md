## JSON Parser

Things learned:
- JSON
- Lexer
- Parser
- Tokenizer
- Building a library

## LRU Cache

Least Recently Used Cache. Provide fast and efficient way of retrieving data

Requirements:
- Fixed Size: bounds to limit memory usages
- Fast Access: Cache Insert and lookup operation should be fast , preferably O(1) time.
- Replacement of Entry in case , Memory Limit is reached: A cache should have efficient algorithm to evict the entry when memory is full.

Things learned:
- Caching
- Queue (Deque)
- Doubly Linked List
- Hashmaps
