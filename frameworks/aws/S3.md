# S3

### S3 Lifecycle Rules
Set of rules to move data between different tiers, to save storage cost

Example: `General Purpose => Infrequent Access => Glacier`

### AWS S3 - Versioning
- You can version your files in AWS S3
- It is enabled at the bucket level
- Same key overwrite will increment the “version”: 1, 2, 3....
- It is best practice to version your buckets
    - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
    - Easy roll back to previous version
- Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
- You can “suspend” versioning

### S3 Cross Region Replication
- _Must enable versioning_ (source and destination)
- Buckets _must be in different AWS regions_
- _Can be in different accounts_
- Copying is _asynchronous_
- Must give proper **IAM permissions** to S3
- **Use cases**: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts

### ETag (Entity Tag)

How do you verify if a file has already been uploaded to S3?

Using ETag, we can ensure **integrity** of files

- For simple uploads (less than 5GB), it’s the MD5 hash
- For multi-part uploads, it’s more complicated, no need to know the algorithm

### S3 Performance

- Faster upload of large objects (>5GB), use **multipart upload**
- Use **CloudFront** to **cache** S3 objects around the world (improves reads)

There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3
- SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
    - AES-256 encryption type
- SSE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
- SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
    - HTTPS must be used
    - server-side encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer outside of AW
- Client Side Encryption
    - Client library such as the Amazon S3 Encryption Client
    - Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3
