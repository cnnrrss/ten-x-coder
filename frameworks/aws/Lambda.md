# Lambda

A compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 

Executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.

You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. 

You cannot log in to compute instances, or customize the operating system or language runtime.
